## Spotii Checkout Plugin integration for OpenCart 

The Spotii Checkout Plugin serves as a payment gateway and has been developed for OpenCart version 3.0.2.0. 

 

*OpenCart install files and paths*: 

Installation of the Spotii Checkout Plugin requires *10 files* to be placed in certain locations within your OpenCart code / project folder. Please copy each file (all named spotii.*) to the corresponding location in the Opencart folder as mentioned below: 

File inside the following folder in OC_Spotii_plugin_master.zip / folder 

Desired location of this file in Opencart folder 

    Admin Controller : admin/controller/extension/payment/ 

    Admin Language File : admin/language/en-gb/extension/payment/ 

    Admin Model File : admin/model/extension/payment/ 

    Admin View File : admin/view/template/extension/payment/ 

    Image File : admin/view/image/payment/ 

    Catalog Controller : catalog/controller/extension/payment/

    Catalog Model : catalog/model/extension/payment/ 

    Catalog View File ‚Äì Spotii.twig and Spotii_error.twig : catalog/view/theme/default/template/extension/payment/
